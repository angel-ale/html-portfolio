    <h1>The Best Movies According to Angel</h1>
    <h2>My Top Three Movies Right Now</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
    <p>
      What I loved most about this movie was the detail in the music and sound
      design. The sound was so crisp and almost tactile. The movie was an
      immersive experience.

    <h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
    <p>
      Where do I begin?!?! The layers on this film were beyond my expectations.
      The way the actors had to quickly adapt within even just the same scene
      was impressive. I have never seen a movie like this; wild is an
      understatement. It also has heartfelt themes of immigrant experiences,
      family, motherhood, identity, and mental health.

    <h3>Suzume</h3>
    <p>
      This movie was visually stunning! It was a beautiful story and the plot
      kept me on the edge of my seat.
