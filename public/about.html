    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Angel. Most of my work experience has been in public education.
      I began as a guitar teacher for an elementary school afterschool program,
      and went on to fill many different roles as a paraprofessional in the
      school, as a teacher's aid, and as the computer lab instructor. I
      currently work at a warehouse driving forklifts.
    </p>
    <p>I love phá»Ÿ, ceviche, and avocados!</p>

    <p>
      I have aspirations as a software engineer and I'm interested in how
      technology intersects with our understanding and perception of reality. I
      want to learn about how technology integrates with our psychology and how
      it takes ancient indigenous practices like curanderismo into contemporary
      understandings and praxis of spirituality, and how technologies like
      virtual reality mirror dream states and experiences with psychedelic
      medicine in indigenous healing ceremonies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to reimagine what technological advancement and developmental
      progress looks like, while also preserving, and restoring, ancestral
      wisdom and culture.
